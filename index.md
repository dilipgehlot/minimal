# Tensorflow Index

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

### Tesnorflow Advantages

1. Open-source platform
It is an open-source platform that makes it available to all the users around and ready for the development of any system on it.

2. Data visualization
TensorFlow provides a better way of visualizing data with its graphical approach. It also allows easy debugging of nodes with the help of TensorBoard. This reduces the effort of visiting the whole code and effectively resolves the neural network.

3. Keras friendly
TensorFlow has compatibility with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections in it. Keras provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow, such as pipelining, estimators, and eager execution.

4. Scalable
Almost every operation can be performed using this platform. With its characteristic of being deployed on every machine and graphical representation of a model allows its users to develop any kind of system using TensorFlow.

5. Compatible
It is compatible with many languages such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in.

6. Parallelism
TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems.

7. Architectural support
TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate.

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
